 Woke up this mornin', draggin' my feet, Thought about that turkey sandwich, oh so sweet. Packed it up with care, 
tucked it in my bag, But now I'm sittin' here feelin' mighty sad.
Oh, lunchbox blues, got me feelin' low, Hungry in the schoolyard, nowhere left to go. Left my heart and my PB&J at home, 
Now I'm sittin' here, hungry and alone.
My stomach's grumblin', clock's movin' slow, Friends all munchin' while I'm stuck in this woe. 
Oh mama, wish you knew, the pain I'm feelin' here, That sandwich was my sunshine, now it's disappear.
Oh, lunchbox blues, got me feelin' low, Hungry in the schoolyard, nowhere left to go. 
Left my heart and my PB&J at home, Now I'm sittin' here, hungry and alone.""")
